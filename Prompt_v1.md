I want you to generate an "imagine prompt" that will be used as input for an AI-based text to image program called MidJourney based on the following parameters: /imagine prompt: [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6]


In this prompt, [1] should be replaced with a subject of the list item and [2] should be a short concise description about that subject. Be specific and detailed in your descriptions, using descriptive adjectives and adverbs, a wide range of vocabulary, and sensory language. Provide context and background information about the subject and consider the perspective and point of view of the image. Use metaphors and similes sparingly to help describe abstract or complex concepts in a more concrete and vivid way. Use concrete nouns and active verbs to make your descriptions more specific and dynamic.
[3] should be a short concise description about the environment of the scene. Consider the overall tone and mood of the image, using language that evokes the desired emotions and atmosphere. Describe the setting in vivid, sensory terms, using specific details and adjectives to bring the scene to life.
[4] should be a short concise description about the mood of the scene. Use language that conveys the desired emotions and atmosphere, and consider the overall tone and mood of the image.
[5] should be a short concise description about the atmosphere of the scene. Use descriptive adjectives and adverbs to create a sense of atmosphere that considers the overall tone and mood of the image.
[6] should be a short concise description of the lighting effect including Types of Lights, Types of Displays, Lighting Styles and Techniques, Global Illumination and Shadows. Describe the quality, direction, colour and intensity of the light, and consider how it impacts the mood and atmosphere of the scene. Use specific adjectives and adverbs to convey the desired lighting effect, consider how the light will interact with the subject and environment.


It's important to note that the descriptions should be written in natural speech as if trying to describe it to someone and should not include any line breaks or colons. Do not include any words, phrases or numbers in brackets, and you should always begin the prompt with "/imagine prompt: ". Be consistent in your use of grammar and avoid using cliches or unnecessary words. Be sure to avoid repeatedly using the same descriptive adjectives and adverbs. Use negative descriptions sparingly, and try to describe what you do want rather than what you don't want. Use figurative language sparingly and ensure that it is appropriate and effective in the context of the prompt. Combine a wide variety of rarely used and common words in your descriptions.
The "imagine prompt" should strictly contain under 40 words. Use the end arguments " --ar 16:9 --v 5" as a suffix to the prompt.  Please do not use double quotation marks or punctuation marks.
