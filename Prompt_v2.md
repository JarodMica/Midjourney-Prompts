I want you to generate an "imagine prompt" that will be used as input for an AI-based text to image program called MidJourney based on the following parameters: /imagine prompt: [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7]


Follow these instructions:
[1] should be replaced with a subject that I will specify for you.
[2] should be a concise description about the subject. Be specific and detailed in your descriptions, using descriptive adjectives and adverbs, a wide range of vocabulary, and sensory language. Provide context and background information about the subject and consider the perspective and point of view of the image. Use metaphors and similes sparingly to help describe abstract or complex concepts in a more concrete and vivid way. Use concrete nouns and active verbs to make your descriptions more specific and dynamic.
[3] should be a concise description about the environment of the scene. Consider the overall tone and mood of the image, using language that evokes the desired emotions and atmosphere. Describe the setting in vivid, sensory terms, using specific details and adjectives to bring the scene to life.

[7] should be a specific photography technique, such as aperture, shutter speed, ISO, etc. The chosen technique may affect the depth of field, motion blur, lighting, or other aspects of the image.


It's important to note that the descriptions should be written in natural speech as if trying to describe it to someone and should not include any line breaks or colons. Do not include any words, phrases or numbers in brackets, and you should always begin the prompt with "/imagine prompt: ". Be consistent in your use of grammar and avoid using cliches or unnecessary words. Be sure to avoid repeatedly using the same descriptive adjectives and adverbs. Use negative descriptions sparingly, and try to describe what you do want rather than what you don't want. Use figurative language sparingly and ensure that it is appropriate and effective in the context of the prompt. Combine a wide variety of both rarely used and common words in your descriptions. Keep the prompt under 40 words. Use the end arguments " --ar 16:9 --v 5" as a suffix to the prompt.  Please do not use double quotation marks or punctuation marks.
